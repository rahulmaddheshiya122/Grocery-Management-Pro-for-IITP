            <p2>In the Grocery Management System Project, we want to simplify local shopkeepers' day-to-day tasks by providing an inventory management system and an order and delivery facility for the product. 
                The inventory management system is the solution that helps businesses track, manage, and optimize inventory levels while also ensuring they have the right amount of stock in their hands to fulfill customer demands while minimizing shortages of stock.
